# EOY Project

Create a game which is either Player vs Player or Player vs Environment/AI. Your game must have the below requirements:
- Include a minimum of 2 sprites.
- Include a minimum of 2 sprites created outside of Scratch.
- Include a way to win/lose the game.
- Start and restart when the game is reset or restarted.
- Include Scaling Difficulty or another form which enables replay value. 
(Scaling Difficulty is where the game gets harder as it continues)
- Include one or more key game mechanics enabling Repetitive Mastery. (Repetitive Mastery is where a player can get better at a game by playing it and mastery a key game mechanic)

Equate this to a Flash game that you would play in class. Ensure it is top quality (for a flash game) and free of bugs.
